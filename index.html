        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a fourth-year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am an aspiring educator. My objective is to become a high school teacher, and I want to work with underserved communities. Specifically, I want to work with emergent bilingual students. I want to work with this specific population because of my own experience as an emergent bilingual student within the education system. My goal is to advocate for these groups of students by bridging the communication gap that exists between students and teachers. More importantly, I want to encourage this group of students to pursue higher education.<br><br>

        First, I have spent four years working as a tutor multiple settings, and with a variety of age groups. My main focus has been elementary school. I have worked in school districts within the Riverside area, and I have had the opportunity to work with students in grades K-6. Although the age group is younger, my main focus has always been working with emergent bilingual students. For example, I have had to translate information between teachers and students. Moreover, I have had to help students develop their English proficiency while encouraging their home language. <br><br>

        Second, I have also had the opportunity to work with older students. I have served as a Peer Educator at the University of California, Riverside for two years. During this time, I had the opportunity to work alongside first-year students, or students that have come to college right out of high school. As a Peer Educator, I got the opportunity to help this group of students navigate their first-year in college. For example, I worked in a learning community that helped students pick their college major, and their career. In fact, a majority of students came from emergent bilingual backgrounds. I noticed that these groups of students often were first-generation students. As a result, I worked closely with them by providing additional resources as well as career guidance.<br><br>
        
        To conclude, my experiences have led me to consider a career as a high school teacher. I can apply the skills I have earned in the elementary school setting to the high school setting. In particular, I am able to work alongside emergent bilingual because I understand their linguistic and educational needs. Moreover, my experience as a Peer Educator has influenced me to work with this specific age group. As a matter of fact, I would like to take the knowledge from this position, and apply it in a high school setting. Specifically, I would like to encourage high school students to pursue a higher education by talking about the college experience; and the what is required to get into college.<br><br>
